    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Mirror Paint</h3>
    <p>
	For my first programming project, concluding the 2 week programming bootcamp at City (2020), I decided to create a paint program,
	with an added touch. It mirrors your brush with some simple transformations, giving a kaleidoscopic effect. I used a for loop 
	to rotate the brush stroke in real time, and added perlin noise on the stroke to get a rainbow effect. This project demonstrates a 
	comprehensive understanding of the use of loops, transformations, and user interaction. Once you hold down the 
	left mouse button, you can start painting. If you decide you want to start over again, you can press the 'n' key to wipe the 
	canvas. Pressing the 'f' key will increase the amount of times your stroke will be mirrored, and the 'd' key will decrease it. 
	Once you've drawn something you like and want to save it, pressing the 's' key will save your drawing as a jpeg, in the folder of the sketch.
	You can see some of the designs I made earlier below.
